                  #INPUT COMPONENT#

The Input component is developed based on a freeform design.

The components are designed as if they were an independent part of a separate library used within an unknown project.

All state management is taken outside the components themselves, i.e. the components are developed as Functional Components.

The Input component can be represented as Stories in a Storybook with a prepared playground and can be integrated into any other component library.
